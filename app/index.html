                  Oiran were courtesans in Japan. The oiran were considered a type of <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Woman of pleasure, or prostitute">yūjo</a>. However, they are distinguished from ordinary yūjo in that they were entertainers, and many became celebrities outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends and, because of this, cultural aspects of oiran traditions continue to be preserved to this day.

                  The Oiran's appearance is supposed to attract customers. Her kimono is made to get her the attention. She is extravagantly dressed, typically in a kimono with patterns in gold and with strong vivid coloursmade of the purest silk with many layers. The Tayuu is the highest-ranked Oiran, and in addition to the kimono she also wears a special <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="A sash for traditional Japanese dress">obi</a> called <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="A highly formal kimono worn only by a bride or at a stage performance.">uchikake</a> which is tied at the front.

                        the geta shoes of the Oiran are about 15 cm tall.

The Oiran also walk in a particular style knows as <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Outside Figure 8 sign">Soto-Hachi-Monji</a> and her walking style is considered a type of art in itself.

This both showed their endurance during the cold winter, and at the same time made men go crazy just by sight of the bare skin. But even here the Oiran ladies didn’t go completely without cover; instead their bare skin was painted white, which also was the case for any part of their bodies that was not covered in cloth.

                <h5 class="center-align">Geisha</h5>
                <p class="right-align">In the early stages of Japanese history, there were female entertainers: <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Serving Girls" data-position="right">saburuko</a> were mostly wandering girls whose families were displaced from struggles in the late 600s. Some of these saburuko girls sold sexual services, while others with a better education made a living by entertaining at high-class social gatherings. After the imperial court moved the capital to Heian-kyō (Kyoto) in 794 the conditions that would form Japanese Geisha culture began to emerge, as it became the home of a beauty-obsessed elite. Skilled female performers, such as Shirabyōshi dancers, thrived.
                </p>
                <p class="right-align">
                Traditional Japan embraced sexual delights (it is not a Shinto taboo) and men were not constrained to be faithful to their wives. The ideal wife was a modest mother and manager of the home; by Confucian custom love had secondary importance. For sexual enjoyment and romantic attachment, men did not go to their wives, but to courtesans. Walled-in <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Pleasure quarters" data-position="right">yūkaku</a> were built in the 16th century, and in 1617 the shogunate designated "pleasure quarters", outside of which prostitution would be illegal, and within which <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Play women" data-position="right">yūjo</a> would be classified and licensed.
                </p>
                <p class="right-align">
                 The highest yūjo class was the Geisha's predecessor, called "Tayuu", a combination of actress and prostitute, originally playing on stages set in the dry Kamo riverbed in Kyoto. They performed erotic dances and skits, and this new art was dubbed kabuku, meaning "to be wild and outrageous". The dances were called "kabuki," and this was the beginning of kabuki theater.

                <p class="left-align">
                  Courtesan culture arose in the early Edo period (1600–1868). At this time, laws were passed restricting brothels to <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Pleasure quarters" data-position="left">yūkaku</a>, which were walled districts set some distance from the city center.
                </p>
                <p class="left-align">
                 Although there were many such quarters, the three with the most lasting prominence were the Shimabara in Kyoto, the Shinmachi in Osaka, and in Edo (present-day Tokyo), the Yoshiwara. These rapidly grew into large, self-contained neighborhoods offering all manner of entertainment, including fine dining, free performances, and frequent festivals and parades.

                <p class="left-align">
                  In the beginning there was the yujo, or sex worker with no distinction, other than the anecdotal evidence that the prostitute was easily recognizable by her sash or <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="A sash for traditional Japanese dress" data-position="left">obi</a> which was tied in the front.

                <p class="right-align">The geisha who worked within the pleasure quarters were essentially imprisoned and strictly forbidden to sell sex in order to protect the business of the Oiran. While licensed courtesans existed to meet men's sexual needs, machi geisha carved out a separate niche as artists and erudite female companions.
                </p>
                <p class="right-align">
                  By 1800, being a geisha was considered a female occupation (though there are still a handful of male geisha working today). Eventually, the gaudy Oiran began to fall out of fashion, becoming less popular than the chic ("iki") and modern geisha. By the 1830s, the evolving geisha style was emulated by fashionable women throughout society. There were many different classifications and ranks of geisha. Some women would have sex with their male customers, whereas others would entertain strictly with their art forms. Prostitution was legal up until the 1900s, so it was practiced in many quarters throughout Japan.

                <p class="left-align">Compared to yūjo (prostitutes), whose primary attraction was their sexual favors, courtesans were first and foremost entertainers. In order to become an oiran, a woman had to be educated in a range of skills, including the traditional arts of <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Japanese tea ceremony" data-position="left">sadō</a>, <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Flower arranging" data-position="left">ikebana</a>, and calligraphy. Oiran also learned to play a variety of <a href="#" class="tooltipped" data-position="left" data-tooltip="This included the koto, shakuhachi, tsuzumi (hand drum), and shamisen.">instruments.</a>
                </p>
                  <p class="left-align">Unlike a common prostitute, the tayū had sufficient prestige to refuse clients. Her high status also made a tayū extremely pricey—a tayū's fee for one evening was between one ryo and one ryo three bu, well beyond a laborer's monthly wage and comparable to a shop assistant's annual salary.
                </p>
                <p class="left-align">
                  The rise of the geisha ended the era of the oiran. Geisha were originally entertainers who provided a suitable backdrop for the courtesans, and their restrained dress and hairstyles were intended to prevent them from competing with courtesans. However, their sartorial restraint translated into chic, and their relative lack of formality into approachability. They were much less expensive than the courtesans. By the late 19th century, geisha had replaced oiran as the companion of choice for wealthy Japanese men.
                  Oiran continued to see clients in the old pleasure quarters, but they were no longer at the cutting edge of fashion. During World War II, when any show of luxury was frowned upon, courtesan culture suffered. The anti-prostitution laws of 1958 dealt it the final blow.

                <p class="right-align">
                  A notable event is that the geisha (including maiko) of the Kamishichiken district in northwest Kyoto serve tea to 3,000 guests on February 25 in an annual open-air tea ceremony at the plum-blossom festival at Kitano Tenman-gū shrine. As of 2010, these geisha also serve beer in a beer garden at Kamishichiken Kaburenjo Theatre during summer months (July to early September); another geisha beer garden is available at the Gion Shinmonso ryokan in the Gion district. These beer gardens also feature traditional dances by the geisha in the evenings.

                <p class="left-align">Today, there are tayū who entertain as geisha do, no longer providing sex. However, there are fewer than five tayū, in comparison to the three hundred geisha in Kyoto today. The last remaining tayū house is located in Shimabara, which lost its official status as a hanamachi in the late 20th century because of the tayūs' decline.[10] However, some still recognize Shimabara as a "flower town," since geisha and tayū still work there and the activity of the tayū is slowly growing. The few remaining women still currently practicing the arts of the tayū (without the sexual aspect) do so as a preservation of cultural heritage rather than as a profession or lifestyle.
                  <p class="left-align">
                    There are no remaining oiran. The women who play the roles of oiran in courtesan parades are actresses.</p>
